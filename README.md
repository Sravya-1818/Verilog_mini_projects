# Verilog Mini Projects  

This repository contains a collection of **Verilog HDL implementations** of fundamental digital design circuits along with **testbenches**.  
The projects were created to strengthen concepts in **Digital System Design, RTL coding, and functional verification** ‚Äî essential skills for **VLSI Design**.
